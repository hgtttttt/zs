The third, fourth and fifth places went to Ed Sheeran, Post Malone and Eminem, respectively.\n\"This year's Top 10 artists reflect the global appeal of music. From modern-day superstars like Drake, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande, to the rise of genres such as K-Pop, to legacy acts like Queen, fans are exploring and enjoying music of all types and from all corners of the world,\" IFPI said.\n\"South Korean seven-piece boy band BTS take second place on IFPI's list after the massive global success of album 'Love Yourself: Tear,' released in May 2018, and 'Love Yourself: Answer,' released in August 2018,\" it said.\n\"Since their formation in 2013, BTS have established a truly global fanbase – known as the ARMY – and have been instrumental in bringing K-Pop to a global stage,\" according to IFPI.\nThe Global Artist Chart is released annually by IFPI, based on global sales of physical and digital album sales as well as frequency of audio and video streaming.\nThis image of IFPI's Global Artist Chart of 2018, captured from the global body's official website, is provided by Big Hit Entertainment.

{"text": "Gay Marriage Amendment: Meaningless and Mean-Spirited\nAP reports:\nA proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage was headed toward a House vote Tuesday with supporters resigned to another losing effort but determined to highlight it in this fall's elections.\n\"This vote will serve as an opportunity for each and every member of this body to go on record in support or in opposition to protecting the traditional definition of marriage,\" said Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., at the opening of the debate on the proposal to define marriage as a union of a man and a woman.\nOpponents disparaged the measure as both meaningless — the Senate last month decisively rejected the amendment — and mean-spirited.\n\"This bill, to put it simply and bluntly, is about adding discrimination and intolerance to the United States Constitution,\" said Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass.\nIf you missed it the first time around, Richard Ford had a piece in Slate last week in which he wondered, a propos the recent proliferation of gay marriage bans, if they reflected not so much anti-gay bigotry as a \"deeper-seated anxiety about gender and gender roles,\" which earned him a good mauling from a number of Slate readers. (I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest they probably stem from…a bit of both.)\nP.S. Meanwhile, a Colorado gay-rights group yesterday accused Focus on the Family founder James Dobson of manipulating research data to say gays and lesbians are not good parents. The NYU sociologist whose research is an issue called Dobson's interpretation \"a direct misrepresentation of the research.\" The group, Soulforce, set out to march 65 miles to Focus H.Q. in Colorado Springs to confront the man himself.

{"text": "About Those Star and Life Leadership Projects, Part 1 - smtip\nBy: Scott Robertson Posted On: 2013-04-16\nI traded emails last week with a Scouter who'd purchased The Scoutmaster's Other Handbook. He and another adult in his unit were having a dispute about the option in Star and Life (but not Eagle) that lets the Scoutmaster assign a leadership project in lieu of a Scout serving in a position of responsibility. One of them thought a half-day project to clean out a storage shed would suffice; the other thought the project needed to last four months for Star and six months for Life (in other words, as long as the Scout would have served in a position of responsibility).\nSo which of them was right? Probably neither.\nThere's no requirement that the leadership project take a certain number months, but the project should be comparable in skills-development terms to what the Scout would have done in a formal position of responsibility. Here's what the Guide to Advancement (No. 33088) says:\n\"For Star and Life ranks only, a unit leader may assign a leadership project as a substitute for the position of responsibility. If this is done, he or she should consult the unit committee and unit advancement coordinator to arrive at suitable standards. The experience should provide lessons similar to those of the listed positions, but it must not be confused with, or compared to, the scope of an Eagle Scout service project.\"\nI don't think a half-day project would quite measure up, although I could imagine expanding that project to make it work. I also think a project lasting four- to six-months would be comparable in scope to an Eagle project, thus going beyond the expectations behind the requirement.\nWhat do you think? Send me samples of projects you've assigned, and I'll share them in a future tip.\nRepublished with permission of Mark Ray at http://www.eaglebook.com/\nUS Submarine July 1945 off the coast of Japan\n7 Inspirational Scouting Minutes\nSeven Ways to Get Out of Work and Go Camping\nEagle Tips Tonights Ceremony Brought to You in Technicolor\nBird in the wilderness\nIs it Webelos Webelo or WEBELOES\n25 Ways to reuse an old blanket\nThe Mighty Patrol Patch\nMy Boys are About to Graduate to Boy Scouts\nScouts of the World Award Discovery in UK\nSlow Steady\nRunning with the wrong crowd", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}}
